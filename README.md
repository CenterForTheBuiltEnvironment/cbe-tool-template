# CBE Tool Templates

The content of this repository should be used as a reference for:
- designing the front-end of CBE tools (e.g., consistent header and footers) using [HTML](templates) and [CSS](static/css/cbe-styles.css) styling templates
- setting up a proper project structure, incl. a detailed README and [documentation](docs)

### Repository structure

- `templates/`
    - `index.html`: Basic HTML containers for headers and footers.
- `static/`
  - `js/`: JavaScript scripts.
  - `css/`: CSS stylesheets.
    -`cbe-styles.css`: CBE-specific styles.
  - `img/`: Official CBE, Berkeley and Social logos.
- `docs`: Folder containing documentation content, ideally link this one to a GitBook.
- `README.md`: README template. Use the second part of this README (â†“) as template for your own project.
